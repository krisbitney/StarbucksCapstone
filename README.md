# StarbucksCapstone

This is my capstone project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Starbucks provided a simulated dataset on a series of A/B tests wherein Starbucks app members are issued seven promotional offers over a 30 day period. There are 10 different offers. At each of the seven assignment dates, about 75% of members are randomly assigned one of the ten possible offers.
